# POSN COMPUTER SCIENCE - Camp 1 Solutions (October 2023)

These solutions were written during the **POSN Computer Science Camp 1**, held in **October 2023** and hosted by **KMUTT (King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi)**. The onsite camp took place at **Streesrisuriyothai School**.

They taught us well, took great care of us, and made sure we were well-fedâ€”buffet and all before the final exam. This repo includes my personal solutions to the exercises given during the camp.
